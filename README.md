ðŸ‘‹ Hi there, Iâ€™m @geoph9

- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in NLP, Speech Processing, and local-only smart home systems, among other things.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning more about curriculum learning and unsupervised/lightly-supervised speech recognition.
- I'm always open to collaborate on new topics!
